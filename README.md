# 2023 National Service Software Engineering Candidates Coding Challenge

Thank you for your interest in the National Service Software Engineering position at Arkesel. We appreciate the time you've taken to apply and would like you to participate in a coding challenge as the next step in our evaluation process.

The coding challenge consists of five questions that will help us assess your problem-solving and programming skills. You can use any programming language of your choice to solve these problems.

Please find below detailed instructions, input format, output format, and additional requirements for each question.

**Question 1 - Palindrome Check**

Determine if the given string is a palindrome.

*Input Format:*

-   A string **s** consisting of lowercase English letters (1 \<=
    s.length \<= 10\^4)

*Output Format:*

-   A boolean value indicating whether the input string is a palindrome
    or not.


**Question 2 - Binary Search**

Implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target value in a sorted array.

*Input Format:*

-   A sorted array of integers **arr** (1 \<= arr.length \<= 10\^5,
    -10\^4 \<= arr\[i\] \<= 10\^4)

-   An integer **target** (-10\^4 \<= target \<= 10\^4)

*Output Format:*

-   An integer representing the index of the target value in the array,
    or -1 if the target value is not present in the array.

**Question 3 - Longest Common Prefix**

Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

*Input Format:*

-   An array of strings **strs** (1 \<= strs.length \<= 10\^4, 1 \<=
    strs\[i\].length \<= 100)

*Output Format:*

-   A string representing the longest common prefix of the input
    strings.

**Question 4 - Merge Intervals**

Given an array of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals and return the merged intervals.

*Input Format:*

-   An array of intervals **intervals** (1 \<= intervals.length \<=
    10\^4, 0 \<= intervals\[i\]\[0\] \<= intervals\[i\]\[1\] \<= 10\^4)

*Output Format:*

-   An array of intervals, representing the merged overlapping
    intervals.

**Question 5 - Linked List Cycle Detection**

Determine if a linked list has a cycle in it.

*Input Format:*

-   A **ListNode** object representing the head of a singly-linked list.
    Each **ListNode** object has the following properties:

    -   **val**: an integer representing the node\'s value (0 \<= val
        \<= 10\^4)

    -   **next**: a reference to the next **ListNode** object in the
        list, or **None** if it is the last node

*Output Format:*

-   A boolean value indicating whether a cycle exists in the linked
    list.
